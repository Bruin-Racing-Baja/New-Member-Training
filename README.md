# New-Member-Training

Training and example repository for new members to become familiar with Github and the development process. The code contained in this repo will be created and pushed by the new members. Note, that some additional setup has been done to streamline the process and introduce ideas like automatic formatting and standardized documentaiton to new members.

# Personal Bios

Put a little bit about yourself! Note, this is described in the oboarding task for new members--you will get a detailed description on how to make changes to the repository there.
